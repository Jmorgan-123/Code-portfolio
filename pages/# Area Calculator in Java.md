 # Area Calculator in Java

This Java program calculates the area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle based on user input. It uses a `Scanner` object to read input from the console and a `switch` statement to handle different shapes.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Importing the `Scanner` Class

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

This line imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the console.

### 2. Defining the `main` Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // ...
}
```

The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It is called when the program is executed.

### 3. Creating a `Scanner` Object

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

This line creates a `Scanner` object that reads input from the standard input stream, which is usually the console.

### 4. Prompting the User to Choose a Shape

```java
System.out.print("Choose a shape (circle, rectangle, triangle): ");
String shape = scanner.nextLine();
```

This code prompts the user to choose a shape from the options "circle", "rectangle", or "triangle". The user's input is stored in the `shape` variable.

### 5. Handling Different Shapes with a `switch` Statement

```java
switch (shape) {
    case "circle":
        // ...
        break;
    case "rectangle":
        // ...
        break;
    case "triangle":
        // ...
        break;
    default:
        // ...
}
```

The `switch` statement handles different shapes based on the value of the `shape` variable. Each case block contains the code to calculate the area of the corresponding shape.

### 6. Calculating the Area of a Circle

```java
case "circle":
    System.out.print("Enter the radius: ");
    double radius = scanner.nextDouble();
    double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
    System.out.println("The area of the circle is: " + area);
    break;
```

This code calculates the area of a circle. It prompts the user to enter the radius of the
