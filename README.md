                <p>During fall semester last year, I developed a practical application called the Benson's Kiosk Management App. 
                    This project aimed to assist Mr. Benson, run his business efficiently . Here are the features of the app:</p>
                <li><h5>Features</h5>

inventory of products. It allows you to add new products, update the details of existing products,
view details of specific products, view all products, delete a product, sell a product, view
transactions, and generate a balance sheet</p></li>
                            <li><p>It computes the total sales and total purchases for each day, providing Mr. Benson with a clear overview of his business transactions.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Based on the sales and purchase data, the app automatically calculates the daily profit. 
                                It subtracts the total purchase cost from the total sales revenue</p></li>
                            <li><p>Mr. Benson can quickly assess how well his kiosk is performing financially.</p></li>

                            <li>The app maintains a digital record of daily transactions. 
                                Each day’s data is stored in a file</li>
                            <li>Mr. Benson can easily retrieve historical information whenever needed. 
                                Whether it’s for tax purposes or business analysis, the app ensures that crucial data is organized and accessible.</li>
                        </ul>
